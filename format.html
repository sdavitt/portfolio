                    <p>Good food brings people together and I love cooking for my friends and family. My favorite recipe
                        is handmade capellini aglio e olio. I also have a passion for making cocktails- my favorite
                        being the Pegu Club (a gin drink invented in the late 19th century in modern day Myanmar and
                        repopularized by the famous cocktail bar of the same name in New York City).</p>

                    <p>Growing up in New England, I spent lots of time in the outdoors hiking in the White Mountains of
                        New Hampshire. A long term goal of mine is to summit every 4000ft.+ mountain in New Hampshire
                        (some 48 peaks). I've been lucky enough to have hiked all across the world including in the
                        Andes in Argentina, the Swiss Alps, and Haleakala National Park in Hawaii. In 2015, I summited
                        Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the highest mountain in Africa at 19,341ft.</p>

                    <p>I've been an avid athlete my entire life. I grew up playing mostly tennis and soccer, and went on
                        to work as a tennis coach for a number of years. More recently, I have taken up mixed martial
                        arts- training primarily in kickboxing and muay thai (thai boxing) as well as some brazilian jiu
                        jitsu. However, I am currently unable to train as I am rehabbing a torn labrum and biceps tendon
                        injury.</p>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="images/headshot.png"></img>
                    <p>My name is Sam Davitt. I'm a 23 year old aspiring developer from Boston, MA. I grew up in Boston
                        before attending Washington University in St. Louis for three years. After changing my major
                        multiple times and struggling with my mental health and traditional academia, I decided to step
                        back from college. Now, I am looking to start a career as a programmer. I enjoy and excel at
                        logic puzzles and find coding to so far hold the same types of fun challenges. Pursuing a career
                        in a field in high demand that I find fun and challenging seems like a dream. So, I'm excited to
                        build my mastery and follow that dream.</p>
